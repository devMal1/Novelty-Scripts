    git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim

NOTE: When using the tagbar if you get a message stating that exuberant tags cannot be found (or
something like that) then it must be compiled and installed:
    1. cd ~/.vim/bundle/exuberant-ctags
    2. ./configure
    3. make
    4. make install
    5. make clean (this is optional)
(steps gathered from here: https://github.com/jakedouglas/exuberant-ctags/blob/master/INSTALL)
