# Novelty-Scripts

> Random/general scripts that I develop as I find convenient.

## Running *nscripts*
- Make sure the user's permissions can execute script: `chmod u+x <nscript>`
- You can run **aliases.sh** for a short description of each of the other *nscripts*, as well as the way to execute the *nscripts* from the command line (including their shorter aliases).
- *NOTE: The aliases assume that the root directory (Novelty-Scripts, or whatever you named the repo's dir) is located at your home directory (~/)*
